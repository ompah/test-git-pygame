Game Mechanics
    Description

        tickets have each a value and thats the game points. 
        the more tickets you solve, the more points. points are 1-6.
        events and team have a 1-6 die on them, indicating its duration.
        each turn, players decide initiative who plays first, 
        then plays cards that either adds time(die count) to tickets, 
        or removes time from tickets to solve them and get points. 
        team members can sometimes help, but not always. 
        when points by tickets solved are x that player wins.
